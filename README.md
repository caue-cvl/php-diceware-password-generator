## üé≤ Diceware Method

Diceware is a simple method to create strong, random passwords using dice and a list of words. The big difference between this method and others (like generating random characters) is you can actually remember your password without needing a password manager, while still being protected against brute-force attacks.

### Why Does Diceware Work?

The length of a password is a major factor in protecting against brute-force attacks. A longer password takes much more time to crack. With Diceware, you build a long password using real words, making it both secure and memorable.
For example, the three shortest words from the word list I generated for this project are:

1. VAR
2. Sub
3. Red

Even with short words, the total length adds up, making the password stronger.

### Roll Dice to Pick Words

- 1 die ‚Üí 6 possible outcomes (1-6)

- 2 dice ‚Üí 36 possible outcomes (6 √ó 6 = 36)

- 3 dice ‚Üí 216 possible outcomes (6 √ó 6 √ó 6 = 216)

> The more dice you roll, the bigger the list of words you can pick from, making your password more secure.

### Generating a Password with 3 Words & 2 Dice

In this project I used 36 words, it means we are using 2 dice. We roll two dice three times to select 3 words for our password

1. Rolling 3 & 4 ‚Üí Look at position 34 in the word list ‚Üí ‚ÄúCorner‚Äù
2. Rolling 1 & 2 ‚Üí Look at position 12 ‚Üí ‚ÄúGoal‚Äù
3. Rolling 5 & 6 ‚Üí Look at position 56 ‚Üí ‚ÄúPlaymaker‚Äù

Our final password: `@Corner Goal Playmaker` 

### Importance of Special Character

A simple but effective trick to make your password even stronger is adding a special character at the beginning.

Remember when you saw that your password could take 3,000 years to crack? Look at how much the time decreases without that special character.

## üíª Requirement

You will need a server to run the PHP file, you can simulate this with `XAMPP`.

### Installing

1. Download the [XAMPP Installer EXE](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

2. Install it.

3. After install `XAMPP`, click in Explorer Folder Icon.
